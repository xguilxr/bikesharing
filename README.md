# bikesharing

Using Tableau to analyze and visually report Bikesharing Data in NYC to pitch the idea in Des Moines. 

# Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the feasibility of making an investment for the bike rental business in a different city (in this case Des Moines). One of the most important factors that will be taken into consideration is "tripduration". This factor lets us know long trips in August are we can use that information to know when the bikes are rented, for how long, and what are the peak times. A modification of the original csv file was made to convert time into a modifiable format. The analysis also takes into consideration genders and users vs customers.

# Results:

Using tableau 7 different visualizations were made and different inputs were analyzed. 

There was an error trying to convert gender in integer form to Strings in Tableau as per the following image:

- There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.

- From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.

- There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.

- There is a larger share of male customers/users, followed by female and ultimately by unknown. 

- If you look at  trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.

# Summary

Having used Tableau for the visualization of the data one can make a fair assumption that this is a good idea for busy cities. Although this analysis is just for one of the busiest months, it would be a good idea to make a visualization per month of rides and another one for trip durations per month with their own specific smaller analyses.
